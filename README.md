# 'Mobile Care'
'Mobile Care' is an Android application developed as part of research carried out as part of a final year honours project. The research examines how technology can be used to assist those who care for individuals with Dementia. This application is a proof of concept that allows carers to sign up for the service to add indivduals to their carer profile. Each carer has a unique login in which they can add information about each individual in their care. 

### PLEASE NOTE THIS APPLICATION IS A PROTOTYPE AND IS NOT YET READY FOR USE IN REAL SCENARIOS
